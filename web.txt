Part 6: Explain How the Web Works
How does the internet work? What happens when you click on a link?

The internet works when we connect to the internet through browsers such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc. We access these different browsers on our computers which are also called servers where they are installed. Basically, our computers send web requests and receive web responses and they also read CSS and HTML and JavaScript. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. It describes the structure of a Web page and tells the browser how to display the content. Designers create a wide range of web pages that can be read by Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and other browsers. We code in JavaScript to work with webpages through HTML and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). For the internet to work, millions of complicated mathematical operations are done with large amounts of data around the world. Computers/ servers are  interconnected and there are countless different components that have to work together to display webpages on our browsers. 

When you click on a link you are using a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) to connect to the internet. The URL is made up of different parts. Most notably "https://" is the protocal that is recognized all over the world. This is how information is transmitted and used by the browser and the server across a webpage. For example, www.Google.com is called a domain name. It's the address of the website converted to be read by the computer. This is also known as the IP (Internet Protocol) address. This translation allows makes it easier to remember the URL. Then the computers request is sent to a specific place within the Google domain. The server processes the request and replies with Javascript or HTML code that makes up the webpage that the user will see.
